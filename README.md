# template

It's Flutter boilerplate for understanding firebase and riverpod.

Difficult to understand using packages.

So I refereced these resources [starter_architecture_flutter_firebase](https://github.com/bizz84/starter_architecture_flutter_firebase), [riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/)

I want to make simple this project. I also not fully understand what flutter and many packeges work.

It's okay. I'm getting better alse you too.
